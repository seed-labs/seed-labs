# Firewall Evasion Lab

## For Ubuntu 20.04

The docker's iptables setting causes problems to this 
lab.  I haven't figured out the actual reason yet. 
We are going to redesign this lab. For now, we will
unpublish this lab.


## Container Setup

Using container will make this lab much more interesting. 
Instead of revising this lab for the container setup, 
we will create a completely new lab in the near future.
