\section{Overview}

On September 24, 2014, a severe vulnerability in Bash was identified.
Nicknamed Shellshock, this vulnerability can exploit many systems and be
launched either remotely or from a local machine.  In this
lab, students need to work on this attack, so they can understand the
Shellshock vulnerability. The learning objective of this lab is for students to get a
first-hand experience on this interesting attack, understand how it
works, and think about the lessons that we can get out of this
attack. The first version of this lab was developed on September 29, 2014, 
just five days after the attack was reported. It was assigned to the students 
in our Computer Security class on September 30, 2014. An important mission
of the SEED project is to quickly turn real attacks 
into educational materials, so instructors can bring them into their
classrooms in a timely manner and keep their students engaged with what
happens in the real world. This lab covers the following topics:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Shellshock
\item Environment variables 
\item Function definition in Bash
\item Apache and CGI programs
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Readings and videos.}
Detailed coverage of the Shellshock attack can be found in the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Chapter 3 of the SEED Book, \seedbook
\item Section 3 of the SEED Lecture at Udemy, \seedcsvideo
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Web Server and CGI}

In this lab, we will launch a Shellshock attack on the web server container. 
Many web servers enable CGI, which is a standard method used to generate
dynamic content on Web pages and Web applications. Many CGI programs are
written using shell scripts. Therefore, before a CGI program is executed,
a shell program will be invoked first, and such an invocation is
triggered by a user from a remote computer. If the shell program is
a vulnerable Bash program, we can exploit the Shellshock vulnerable to
gain privileges on the server.


In our web server container, we have already set up a very simple CGI
program (called \texttt{vul.cgi}). 
It simply prints out {\tt "Hello World"} using a shell script.
The CGI program is put inside Apache's default CGI folder \texttt{/usr/lib/cgi-bin},
and it must be executable. 

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=\texttt{vul.cgi}] 
(*@\textbf{\#!/bin/bash\_shellshock}@*)          

echo "Content-type: text/plain"
echo
echo
echo "Hello World"
\end{lstlisting}

The CGI program uses \texttt{/bin/bash\_shellshock} (the first line),
instead of using \texttt{/bin/bash}. This line specifies
what shell program should be invoked to run the script. We do need to use
the vulnerable Bash in this lab.


To access the CGI program from the Web, we can either use a browser by
typing the following URL: \url{http://www.seedlab-shellshock.com/cgi-bin/vul.cgi}, 
or use the following command line program {\tt curl} to do the same thing:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ curl http://www.seedlab-shellshock.com/cgi-bin/vul.cgi
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{DNS Setting.}
In our setup, the web server container's IP address is
\texttt{10.9.0.80}. The hostname of the server is called
\texttt{www.seedlab-shellshock.com}.  
In the SEED VM, we have already 
mapped this hostname to \texttt{10.9.0.80} in \texttt{/etc/hosts}. 
If you are not using the SEED VM, you should add this mapping to your machine.

\section{Lab Tasks}


% -------------------------------------------
% SUBSECTION
% ------------------------------------------- 
\subsection{Task 1: Experimenting with Bash Function}


The Bash program in Ubuntu 20.04 has already been patched, so it is no
longer vulnerable to the Shellshock attack. For the purpose of this lab, we
have installed a vulnerable version of Bash inside the \texttt{/bin}
folder; its name is \texttt{bash\_shellshock}. We need to use 
this Bash in our task. Please first get a shell in the 
web server container ((see the container manual for
instruction; the manual is linked to the lab's website).
Inside the container, run this vulnerable version of Bash like the
following and then design an experiment to verify whether this Bash is
vulnerable to the Shellshock attack or not. 

\begin{lstlisting}
# /bin/bash_shellshock
\end{lstlisting}

Try the same experiment on the patched version of bash (\texttt{/bin/bash})
and report your observations.

% SUBSECTION

\subsection{Task 2: Passing Data to Bash via Environment Variable}


To exploit a Shellshock vulnerability in a Bash-based CGI program, attackers need to 
pass their data to the vulnerable Bash program, and the data need to be
passed via an environment variable. In this task, we need to see how we can
achieve this goal. We have provided another CGI program (\texttt{getenv.cgi}) on the 
server to help you identify what user data can get into the environment
variables of a CGI program. This CGI program prints out all
its environment variables. 


\begin{lstlisting}[caption=\texttt{getenv.cgi}]
#!/bin/bash_shellshock             

echo "Content-type: text/plain"
echo
echo "****** Environment Variables ******"
strings /proc/$$/environ            (*@\ding{192}@*)
\end{lstlisting}


In the code above, Line \ding{192} prints out the contents of all the
environment variables in the current process. If your experiment is
successful, you should be able to see your data string in the page returned
from the server. 
In your report, please explain how the data from a remote user can get into
those environment variables.

\subsection{Task 3: Launching the Shellshock Attack}

We can now launch the Shellshock attack. 
The attack does not depend on what is in the CGI program, as it targets
the Bash program, which is invoked first, before the CGI script is
executed. Your goal is to launch the attack through the URL
\url{http://www.seedlab-shellshock.com/cgi-bin/vul.cgi}, such that you can achieve
something that you cannot do as a remote user. In this task, you should
demonstrate the following:


\begin{itemize} 
\item Using the Shellshock attack to steal the content of a secret file
from the server.  

\item Answer the following question:  will you be able to steal the content of 
the shadow file \texttt{/etc/shadow}? Why or why not?  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Task 4: Getting a Reverse Shell via Shellshock Attack}

The Shellshock vulnerability allows attacks to run arbitrary commands on
the target machine. In real attacks, instead of hard-coding the command 
in their attack, attackers often choose to run a shell
command, so they can use this shell to run other commands,
for as long as the shell program is alive. 
To achieve this goal, attackers need to run a reverse shell.

Reverse shell is a shell process started on a machine, with its input and output being
controlled by somebody from a remote computer. Basically, the shell runs
on the victim's machine, but it takes input from the attacker machine and
also prints its output on the attacker's machine. Reverse shell
gives attackers a convenient way to run commands on a compromised machine. 
Detailed explanation of how to create reverse shell can be found in 
the SEED book. We also summarize the explanation in
the guideline section later.


In this task, you need to demonstrate 
how to launch a reverse shell via the Shellshock vulnerability in a CGI program. 
Please show how you do it. In your report, please also explain 
how you set up the reverse shell, and why it works. Basically, you need to
use your own words to explain how reverse shell works in your Shellshock
attack.

\subsection{Task 5: Using the Patched Bash}

Now, let us use a Bash program that has already been patched.
The program \texttt{/bin/bash} is a patched version.
Please replace the first line of 
the CGI programs with this program. 
Redo Task 3 and describe your observations.
