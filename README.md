This is the core of the entire SEED project, it consists
of all the labs that we have developed and maintained.  


## History

The SEED project started in 2002 by Wenliang Du, a professor at the Syracuse
University. It was funded by a total of 1.3 million dollars from the US
National Science Foundation (NSF). Now SEED labs are being used by over a
thousand institutes around the world. SEED stands for (SEcurity EDucaton).

The project has been maintained by Professor Du himself in the past, with the help
from his students. While this has worked quite well for almost 20 years, 
it has now reached a point, where individual efforts can no longer meet 
the ever increasing needs from the world. There are many interesting things
that we can do if we work together as a community. 

## Vision

Learning by doing is essential for education. 
Our vision is to develop hands-on labs that can help achieve
learning by doing in the cybersecurity education around the world. 
These include well-designed lab exercises, as well as the 
platforms for these labs. These labs and platforms are 
open source.
