This is the core of the entire SEED project, it consists
of all the labs that we have developed and maintained 
for the past 18 years. 


## History

The SEED project started in 2002 by Wenliang Du, a professor at the Syracuse
University. It was funded by a total of 1.3 million dollars from the US
National Science Foundation (NSF). Now SEED labs are being used by over a
thousand institutes around the world. SEED stands for (SEcurity EDucaton).

The project has been maintained by Professor Du himself in the past, with the help
from his students. While this has worked quite well for almost 20 years, 
it has now reached a point, where individual efforts can no longer meet 
the ever increasing needs from the world. There are many interesting things
that we can do if we work together as a community.

## Vision

Learning by doing is essential for education. 
Our vision is to develop hands-on labs that can help achieve
learning by doing in cybersecurity education.
These include lab exercises that are well-designed, interesting, and effective, 
as well as the platforms to support these labs. 
The labs and platforms are open source, so universities,
colleges, and high schools around the world 
can freely use them to enhance their curricula.
