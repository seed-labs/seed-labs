\paragraph{Apache Configuration.}
In our pre-built VM image, we used Apache server to host all the web
sites used in the lab. The name-based virtual hosting feature in
Apache could be used to host several web sites (or URLs) on the same
machine. A configuration file named \texttt{000-default.conf} in the directory
\url{"/etc/apache2/sites-available"} contains the necessary directives for the
configuration:

Inside the configuration file, each web site has a {\tt VirtualHost} block
that specifies the URL for the web site and directory in the file system
that contains the sources for the web site. The following examples show how
to configure a website with URL \url{http://www.example1.com} and another
website with URL \url{http://www.example2.com}:

\begin{lstlisting}
<VirtualHost *>
    ServerName http://www.example1.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/Example_1/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *>
    ServerName http://www.example2.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/Example_2/
</VirtualHost>
\end{lstlisting}


You may modify the web application by accessing the source in the
mentioned directories. For example, with the above configuration,
the web application \url{http://www.example1.com} can be changed by modifying
the sources in the \url{/var/www/Example_1/} directory. After a change is
made to the configuration, the Apache server needs to be restarted. See the
following command:

\begin{lstlisting}[backgroundcolor=]
   $ sudo service apache2 start
\end{lstlisting}
