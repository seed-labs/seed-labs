%\paragraph{Removing the Host VM from \texttt{192.168.60.0/24} network.}
When Docker creates a network, it automatically attach the
host machine (i.e., the VM) to the network. In this
case, the host machine is attached to both
networks, and is given the IP address \texttt{10.9.0.1} and
\texttt{192.168.60.1}.
This may create undesirable situations,
so let's remove it.

In our setup, we only want the VM to be connected to
\texttt{10.9.0.0/24}, not to both.
We need to detach the VM from the other network. We cannot simply power down
the interface, because that will affects all the containers on that network.
Our solution is to remove the IP address
of the interface, and then set the routing accordingly. 
script does exactly that.


\begin{lstlisting}
// Get the name of the interface 
$ ip addr

// Remove the IP address from the interface
$ sudo ip addr flush <interface-name>

// Use 10.9.0.11 as the router to access 192.168.60.0/24
$ sudo ip route add 192.168.60.0/24 via 10.9.0.11
\end{lstlisting}
