# Open-Source CTF Platform

---

Welcome to the SEED CTF platform!  This platform is intended to be used as a companion to the SEED 2.0 Labs, and contains CTF challenges corresponding to many of the Labs in addition to a few not associated with a specific Lab.  

Please see the `manual/README` document for instructions on how to set up and use the platform.

# SEED Labs Covered

Many of the CTF challenges are based on existing [SEED Labs 2.0](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/), and in some cases may reuse source code from the SEED Labs.
The mapping from SEED Labs to corresponding CTF challenges is as follows:
* Cryptography Labs
  - [Crypto Lab -- Secret-Key Encryption](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Crypto/Crypto_Encryption/)
    * `seed-labs/ctf/category-crypto/Encrypted_Image`
    * `seed-labs/ctf/category-crypto/EncryptionnoitpyrcnE`
  - [MD5 Collision Attack Lab](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Crypto/Crypto_MD5_Collision/)
    * `seed-labs/ctf/category-crypto/Sum_More_Stuff_To_Do`
  - [PKI Lab](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Crypto/Crypto_PKI/)
    * `seed-labs/ctf/category-crypto/GPG_Encryption`
  - [Pseudo Random Number Generation Lab](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Crypto/Crypto_Random_Number/)
    * `seed-labs/ctf/category-crypto/Key_Submission`
  - [RSA Encryption and Signature Lab](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Crypto/Crypto_RSA/)
    * `seed-labs/ctf/category-crypto/Do_It_Yourself_Crypto`
* Network Security Labs
  - [Packet Sniffing and Spoofing Lab](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Networking/Sniffing_Spoofing/)
    * `seed-labs/ctf/category-network/Ok_Google_Whats_TCP`
* Software Security
  - [Buffer-Overflow Attack Lab (Server Version)](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Software/Buffer_Overflow_Server/)
    * `seed-labs/ctf/category-software/Too_Much_Flow`
  - [Format-String Vulnerability Lab](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Software/Format_String/)
    * `seed-labs/ctf/category-software/Format_String`
  - [Race-Condition Vulnerability Lab](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Software/Race_Condition/)

## Credits

* Some challenges are based on existing challenges from CTF sources [PicoCTF](https://www.picoctf.org/), [DEFCON Biohacking](https://www.defconbiohackingvillage.org/), and CSICTF.
* This platform was originally developed by [Zack Kaplan](mailto:zack.kaplan@wustl.edu) as part of a Master's project at [Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL)](https://wustl.edu/).
* The work is being continued by [Dylan Simmons](mailto:dylan.simmons@wustl.edu) as part of a Master's project at WUSTL.
* The project development is being advised by [Steve Cole](mailto:svcole@wustl.edu).
