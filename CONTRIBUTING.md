## Types of Contributions We're Looking For

- **Improvement**. Improve the existing SEED labs. There are many ways we can 
improve the existing labs. I am only listing a few examples:

  - Many SEED labs, especially network-security labs, require multiple
    VMs. With the container technology, we should be able to use one VM, 
    plus several containers for the lab environment. This can drastically
    reduce the complexity of the lab setup. 

  - There are always better ways to do things. If you find anything that can
    improve some of the existing tasks, we would like to hear 
    about it.

  - Search for issues with label "help wanted" to find out the specific things 
    we are looking for. If you are very new in open-source projects, 
    you can start from the issues labeled "good first issue". 

- **New labs**. Developing new SEED labs. There are many topics that are 
not covered by the existing SEED labs. If you have expertise in those 
topics, and are interested in developing
one or multiple SEED labs on that topic, we would like to hear your 
proposal, and will work with you to get things started. Here is 
an incomplete list of topics: 

  - Forensics
  - Reverse engineering
  - Intrusion detection
  - Blockchain 
  - AI for security


- **Website**. Maintaining the website, designing artwork (e.g. icons) for each lab.

- **Translation**. Translating these SEED labs into other languages. 
We will create a separate github repository for each language. We look
for people who can take a lead on the translation for each language. 

- **Training and support**. Training and providing support to help the instructors
around the world. Currently, due to COVID-19 pandemic, we 
will only focus on online training. When we conduct training, we need
volunteers to provide help to online participants. We also look for experienced
instructors who can lead training sessions. 

## How to Contribute

If you are interested in improving the existing SEED labs, you can start
creating a fork from this repo, and check the existing issues, and 
starting working on that. When you are done, submit a pull request 
for our review. If you have questions, you can always create an issue, and 
some of us will respond to you.  

## Community

Discussions about the Open Source Guides take place on 
this repository's [Issues](https://github.com/seed-labs/seed-labs/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/seed-labs/seed-labs/pulls) sections. Anybody is welcome to join these conversations. 

Wherever possible, do not take these conversations to private channels, including contacting the maintainers directly. Keeping communication public means everybody can benefit and learn from the conversation.
